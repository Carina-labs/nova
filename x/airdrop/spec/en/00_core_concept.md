# Core Concept

---

Supernova distributes some of its initial issuance to users participating in the main-net.
This is called **airdrop**.

How much will be distributed to a certain user is determined by performing a set quest. The airdrop module manages whether the user performs quests.

## Airdrop

## Quest
