# Pool-Incentive

---

## Abstract

---
The Supernova protocol provides swap for seamless exchange between equity tokens and assets. 
And to assign some of the newly issued Nova coins to the liquidity pool, we use the Pool-Incentive module.

Staked swap is developed in the near future, and we are currently using common amm swaps.

For more information about staked swaps, see the [WhitePaper](https://www.supernovaprotocol.xyz/whitepaper.pdf).
